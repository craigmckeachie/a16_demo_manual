# Instructor Notes

## How the Class Works

### Setup

- [Computer Setup](https://github.com/craigmckeachie/a16_setup/blob/main/readme.md) directions are available online

### Concepts

- Slides are provided to explain concepts
- A PowerPoint is available to the instructor only
- A pdf of the slides is available to students
- Slides often reference demos

### Demos

- [Finished code](https://github.com/craigmckeachie/a16_demos) for each demo is available online in a public GitHub repository.
  - Each demo is a branch
  - See the demo manual for more details on how to access and run the demos
- [Demo Manual](./AngularDemosManual.md) with step-by-step directions for live coding the demos is available online
- Demonstrations are to be done by instructor but not the students
  - students get hands-on with labs see below
  - helps manage class time
- Demo Manual can be shared with students but it is recommended to wait until the end of class

### Labs

- Building an application one step at a time
- Hands-on for attendees
- Step-by-step directions are provided in a pdf lab manual
- [Solution code](https://github.com/craigmckeachie/a16_labs) for each lab is available online in a public GitHub repository
  - Each lab is a separate branch
  - See the lab manual for more details on how to access and run the demos
- If you miss lab or donâ€™t finish a lab, you can pickup on the next one
- The pdfs are not ideal for students to copy and paste code from them. So code snippets are provided in this repository...[code snippets](https://github.com/craigmckeachie/a16_labs_snippets).

### Challenges

- If students are finishing labs before other students and waiting or are requesting labs without as much direction you can point them to the `AngularChallengeManual.pdf`.

## Files

- All pdfs referenced above (slides and lab manual) are provided in a zip file to both the instructor and students
- The pdfs are delivered electronically but are protected to not allow printing or copying of text (code snippets are available on GitHub, see lab manual for more details)

#### Here is a list of the pdf files in each classes zip file:

- AngularCourseIntroduction-[xxxx].zip

  - AngularSlidesIntroduction.pdf
  - AngularLabManualIntroduction.pdf
  - TypeScriptSlides.pdf
  - TypeScriptLabManual.pdf
    > TypeScript content is included/bundled for free with the purchase of Introduction to Angular courseware
  - AngularChallengeManual.pdf

- AngularCourseAdvanced-[xxxx].zip
- AngularCourseComprehensive-[xxxx].zip
  - AngularSlidesIntroduction.pdf
  - AngularLabManualIntroduction.pdf
  - TypeScriptSlides.pdf
  - TypeScriptLabManual.pdf
  - AngularSlidesAdvanced.pdf
  - AngularLabManualAdvanced.pdf
    > TypeScript content is included/bundled for free with the purchase of Comprehensive Angular courseware
  - AngularChallengeManual.pdf
    > Note: I just give Instructors and students both the advanced AND intro pdfs for an advanced class and let them decide where in the materials they want to start.
